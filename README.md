# gRPC With Spring Boot

This repository contains the source code for [**gRPC With Spring Boot**].

# Topics Covered:

- Protocol Buffers (Protobuf):
    - Master Protobuf, understanding Google's language-neutral and platform-neutral serialization format for structured data.
-  Introduction to gRPC:
    - Explore the benefits of gRPC for microservices communication.
    - Delve into the different RPC types supported by gRPC, including Unary API, Client Streaming API, Server Streaming API, and Bidirectional Streaming API.
- Load Balancing:
    - Address challenges in load balancing with gRPC.
    - Explore various load balancing strategies and implement them with gRPC.
- Authentication:
    - Implement user session token passing for authentication in gRPC.
    - Explore client service token passing for authorization in gRPC.
- Error Handling:
    - Master error handling techniques in gRPC.
    - Utilize Protobuf OneOf for error handling and explore error handling through exceptions.
- Spring Boot Integration:
    - Integrate gRPC seamlessly with Spring Boot microservices.
    - Develop multiple services and ensure smooth integration between them.

The power of gRPC is to build highly performant, scalable, and efficient microservices using Protocol Buffers and Spring Boot.
